// Jaden Casing Strings (7kyu)
// Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). 
// Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing 
// every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

// Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. 
// The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

//Parameters: input string = sentence, assume no null values? cound each contraction as full word
//Response: return the string with capitalized words
//Example: How can mirros be real if our eyes aren't real >> How Can Mirros Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real
//Pseudo Code: 1. convert string to array of words, split by spaces. 
//2. for each word, convert to array, shift off the first word and unshift on the first letter at [0] to uppercase and the rest of the letters are the same. 
//3. join array into string using spaces 
//4. return string


String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
    return this.split(' ').map((word,i) => word.replace(word[0], word[0].toUpperCase())).join(' ')
  
}

console.log(("How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real").toJadenCase())
